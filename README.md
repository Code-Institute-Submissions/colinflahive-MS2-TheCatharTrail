# Overview
This is the second Milestone Project within the Code Institues Full Stack Web Development programme which will create
a fully responsive, interactive website available across all devices and will focus on the Languedoc region in the 
South of France.  The objective of the website is to raise awareness of the tranquility of the region and to encourage 
the public to broaden their travel experience and learn how the Cathars lived in this forgotten part of the world.
