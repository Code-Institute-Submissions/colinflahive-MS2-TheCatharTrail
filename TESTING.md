#### Header Section

The Header section is set to 'fixed-top' so that the user does not lose sight of the menu and by clicking on the logo in the top
left corner, it returns the user back to the homepage.  All links to the individual pages were tested and each page opened as

The cards displayed at the bottom of the page highlight the top hotel, restaurant and activity within the region with the image highlighting
the venue.  The cards flip on all devices without any issues and the images display clearly. There were no issues with the social media icons

website only focuses on a select few. The user is able to click on each of the markers on each map which will highlight the name and location
